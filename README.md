Build webapps with bun.js and chromium-based browsers.
This is a project still under construction, please be patient.

#Get Started

To get started with the project, clone the same as follows. open a ternimal and paste this

``` 
git clone https://github.com/Bunland/webapp.git
```
Now go to the project with:
```
cd webapp
```

```
cd myapp 
```

```
bun install
```

Run the application in development mode. 

Go back to the main "webapp" folder and type in the console:

Build the webapp.

Unfortunately "for now", the only way to build our webapp is using the Golang language, so make sure you have golang installed. You can follow the following link which will help you to install Golang easily:
